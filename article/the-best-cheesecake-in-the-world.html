...as a cheesecake groupie (is that a thing?), as a person that has suffered through many cheesecakes until she met the right one, I don&#x2019;t say this lightly. Of course everybody has their unique and individual taste, and considering cheesecake even comes in two very different forms (baked or unbaked), a statement like this is highly vague (you know, a bit like the horoscope). Still I will swear by it, the flavour is amazing.</p>

                <div class="post-body"><p>Phil Dunphy once said &#x201C;the most amazing things that can happen to a human being will happen to you, if you just lower your expectations&#x201D;. So I guess that choosing &#x201C;the best X of the world&#x201D; as a title kind of goes against his theory. Sorry Phil!</p>
<p>But as a cheesecake groupie (is that a thing?), as a person that has suffered through many cheesecakes until she met the right one, I don&#x2019;t say this lightly. Of course everybody has their unique and individual taste, and considering cheesecake even comes in two very different forms (baked or unbaked), a statement like this is highly vague (you know, a bit like the horoscope). Still I will swear by it, the flavour is amazing.</p>
<p>Now this is actually a sort of baked and unbaked version. The result will be as creamy as the unbaked, but it does involve some baking and some long time in the freezer to set. C-r-a-z-y, right? The cookie layer is very very thin, so if you are one of those people that love a really sturdy base, I suggest that you double the quantities.</p>
<p>You can also top it with pretty much anything you like, although it&#x2019;s wonderful without any topping. Blueberries, blackberries, strawberries, x-berries are always a winning combination, because of their smooth tartness and freshness.  I&#x2019;ve done it topping less and with a very basic strawberry sauce (just blend some fresh strawberries with icing sugar until it&#x2019;s smooth and to your taste), decorated with a few raspberries.</p>
<p>I was trying to remember where does my love of cheesecake come from (it&#x2019;s not your typical Portuguese sweet) and I think it comes from my early birthday parties, where my aunt Manuela, who had lived in London for a long time, used to make it. I can st &#x201C;taste&#x201D; its slightly tart flavour. It&#x2019;s funny how some tastes are so strongly ingrained in your mind.</p>
<p>This recipe comes from my favourite Portuguese baker, Leonor de Sousa Bastos, although I think she adapted it from somebody else. She was, apparently, as thrilled as me. It&#x2019;s good to know I was not alone in this very hard quest. </p>

<p><strong>The best cheesecake in the world</strong></p>
<p>For a 20cm spring form pan:</p>
<p>Crust
<em>70g digestive cookies
30g light brown sugar
40g cold melted butter</em></p>
<p>Grease the spring form and place some baking sheet on the bottom. 
Crush the cookies with the sugar until you get a very thing &#x201C;dust&#x201D;.
Mix in the cold butter until combined (like wet sand) and place on the spring form, pressing it down (use the back of a spoon). Place in the freezer. </p>
<p>Filling
<em>500 cream cheese (like Phildapelphia or the same fat amount)
170g caster sugar
2g salt
3 eggs
1 egg yolk
75g cream (at least 35% fat amount)
3ml vanilla extract (don&#x2019;t use a cheap flavouring)
Pre-warm your oven to 160&#xBA;.</em></p>
<p>Mix together the cheese with the salt and sugar, for around 3 minutes.
Whisk together the eggs and the yolk and add them to the mixture, without stopping the whisking.
Add the vanilla extract to the cream and combine with the mixture.</p>
<p>Take the spring form from the freezer and pour over the filling. Smooth the top and beat it on a table, to avoid air bubbles. Put the spring form on a baking tray and fill it with warm water (more or less until half of it is covered). Cook for about one hour and 15m or until the middle is set (make sure there are no cracks forming).</p>
<p>Take the cheesecake from the oven, and let it cool down completely. Run a knife around the egde to make sure it&#x2019;s not sticking to the sides. Place in the fridge uncovered for at least 8 hours (I know it sucks&#x2026;but it&#x2019;s really important!).
To unmould, warm the sides and the bottom slightly (for instance with a burner), and transfer to a plate covered with a baking sheet (so it won&#x2019;t leave marks on top).</p>
