But not this time. There&apos;s hard and there&apos;s too hard. I&apos;ve learned to tell the difference. No shame. No regrets. No looking back.</p>

                <div class="post-body"><p>It&apos;s been two months since I&apos;ve moved out of Berlin. I know it sounds strange since my first post was about beginning, my beginning in Berlin. I did try to love a world where the warmth of the sun was rare. But I guess people are right about love: you can&apos;t force it. </p>
<p>I&apos;ve heard a lot of things ever since I&apos;ve moved back to Portugal: &quot;don&apos;t you feel a bit like a failure?&#x201D; &quot;couldn&apos;t you have tried more?&quot;, &quot;you are really instable with your decisions&quot;, &quot;don&apos;t you feel bad for leaving your boyfriend there?&quot;.
Well, the clich&#xE9; strikes again: you had to be in my shoes to know. It was not an easy choice. It&apos;s never an easy decision for me to give up on something that I initially believed it would make me happy(er). And there were times in my life where I think I should have stayed a little longer. Tried a little harder. Fake it a bit more, for the sake of responsibility. But not this time. There&apos;s hard and there&apos;s too hard. I&apos;ve learned to tell the difference. No shame. No regrets. No looking back.</p>
<p>Now I&apos;m back living in Porto, a city that I have not lived in for almost seven years. 
It feels good to be back. I see the city in a new light. Everything is pretty much the same, but I feel different. Like I have lived other lives. And I did. Oh, I really did. </p>
<p>Lisbon was my previous home and will always be the love of my life. It was there that I&apos;ve become a woman, that I&apos;ve challenged myself the most. Me and her, we grew together. I will always love her. The hilly paths. The hidden corners. That unbelievable light. How we danced together, how sweet and vibrant was our love. But love, by itself, it&apos;s never enough. It was time to leave. </p>
<p>I&apos;m writing this entry from my grandmother&#x2019;s house, from my old room. It&apos;s raining heavily outside, I can almost hear the rage of the tide. I&apos;m not really sure of how my life will unfold from now on. 
I still don&apos;t know what I&apos;ll be when I grow up. The world is going through some really weird turns. 
But I have this sweet melody in my head. </p>
<p>Here&apos;s to the ones who dream.</p>
