        <title>Firsts</title>
        <description>
            I&#x27;ve moved to Berlin 5 months ago. It was the first time that I moved out of my country. And I had actually never been to Berlin before so it&#x27;s hard to explain why I was so excited with the idea some months before deciding. I&#x27;ve always said I wanted...

        <description>
            It&#x27;s been two months since I&#x27;ve moved out of Berlin. I know it sounds strange since my first post was about beginning, my beginning in Berlin. I did try to love a world where the warmth of the sun was rare. But I guess people are right about love: you...

        <description>

        <title>Here comes the sun</title>
        <description>
            &quot;Thanks&quot; to global warming, there are no seasons anymore. At least in Portugal, I can&#x27;t really speak for the world.
